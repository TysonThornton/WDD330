    <div>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
                <p>Take a look at this <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/solutions/week05/hiking-start.html"
                        target="_blank">starter code for a hiking app</a>. It is an example of a small application that
                    takes some data ( in this case an array of objects), and builds out the HTML necessary to display it
                    in the browser. It is simply a collection of functions and variables with no attempt at
                    organization. Since this is a small app we can get away with it, but if it were larger and more
                    complex it could quickly become hard to follow. As complexity increases, code that has no thought
                    towards organization usually turns into 'spaghetti code'.</p>
                <p>Think about how you could use modules, objects, or classes to better organize this code. What modules
                    would you need? What objects would make sense? Discuss this with your group.</p>
                <p>You might start by making a list of all of the functions and properties you think you will need (look
                    that the code for a starting point!). Notice also the stretch goals below...make sure your pattern
                    will allow for the stretch goals to be completed as well.</p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>The process of evaluating code like we are doing to improve it is called
                        <strong>refactoring</strong>, and is a pretty common practice. Note that the output of the code
                        should not change...it should accomplish the same thing at the end as it did in the beginning.
                        Only the organization and structure of the code should change to make it more portable,
                        maintainable, reusable, etc.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Implement the modules, objects, and/or classes you discussed above to organize the Hikes code.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Before you do this, compare your plans with this <a
                        href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/blob/gh-pages/solutions/week05/hikes-stub.js"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">partial solution file</a>. It has a class with methods stubbed
                    out. How does it differ from your plans? Discuss this with your team. You do not need to implement
                    yours exactly like the example...but make sure you understand why each of the properties, methods,
                    and functions are there before continuing.</p>
                <p>With either your groups ideas or using the partial solution file above, write the rest of the code to
                    make the application work.</p>
                <p>I would recommend a structure similar to the following for your application:</p>
                <pre>  index.html 
                        main.js 
                        hikes.js 
                        styles.css 
                  </pre>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Here are a few tips/reminders if you need a bit of help getting your module and class connected up
                    and working. Some of these assume that your module looks similar to the example above:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need a main entry point where you will bring in your modules. Create a
                        <kbd>main.js</kbd> and add that to your HTML with your script element.</li>
                    <li>When using modules you need to tell the HTML file that you want to use
                        modules...<code>&lt;script src="main.js" type="module"&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>You need to <kbd>import</kbd> your module before you can use it. <code>import Hikes from
                            './hikes.js';</code> (This would go in <kbd>main.js</kbd>)</li>
                    <li>If you organized your code using a class that you exported from your module, you need to create
                        an instance of that class before you can use it. You would do this in <kbd>main.js</kbd>:
                        <code>const myHike = new Hikes('hikeListId');</code></li>
                    <li>Once you have your instance, you use it to call the <kbd>showHikeList</kbd> method.
                        <code>myHike.showHikeList()</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="callout">Alternatively, if you would like to implement this using the MVC (Model, View,
                    Controller) pattern you can follow these <a
                        href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/resources/hikes-MVC.html" target="_blank">instructions
                        to see one implementation of modules, classes and MVC</a> to solve this problem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Style it.</p>
                <p>Add the CSS required to make your list of hikes match this wireframe.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
