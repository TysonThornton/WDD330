        <h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
        <p>6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name <br>
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris <br>
            goto the link above and open the console. Paste the following two lines in.  That will create a list of links in memory that you can reference through the console. Use that list to finish the problem. <br>
            const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category'); <br>
            const links = Array.from(category.querySelectorAll('a'));</p>
