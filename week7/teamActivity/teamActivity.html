    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
            <p>If you don't have a working copy of the Great hikes app then you can pull down <a
                    href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer">this version of the working code</a> as a starting point (<a
                    href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/solutions/week05/hikes5.zip">Zip archive</a>).</p>
            <p>Review the code to refresh your memory on the structure we have used. Discuss with your group what
                methods and properties you might need to implement your comments. A comment should consist of at least
                the name of the hike it is for, a date, and the actual text of the comment. You will also need a comment
                <kbd>type</kbd> to use as a key for when we store these to local storage.</p>
            <p class="callout">Type? This is just to allow us to re-use this code. Later you might want to expand on
                this application and add something like favorite parks or climbs, etc. It would be nice to re-use this
                module for each of those. Adding a <kbd>type</kbd> flag allows us to add comments for different things
                and grab all of them or keep them separate.</p>
            <p>It might help here to write out a list of steps that need to happen in order to capture a comment. A
                sample starter list can be found below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When the app loads we see a list of all hikes...below we should also see a list of all comments with
                    type:hike.</li>
                <li>When a hike is touched it will show us the details for that hike. We should also see any comments
                    for that hike, and an input and button to add a new comment.</li>
                <li>When the submit comment button is touched...</li>
            </ol>
            <p>From this we can start to infer some of the methods and properties we will need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>getAllComments</code> and <code>renderCommentList</code> method.</li>
                <li>A comment <code>type</code> to use as a key.</li>
                <li>A <code>filterCommentsByName</code> method.</li>
                <li>An array to hold all of our comments.</li>
                <li>A comment should look something like this:
                    <pre class=" language-js"><code class=" language-js">
        <span class="token keyword">const</span> newComment <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
          name<span class="token punctuation">:</span> hikeName<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
          date<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Date</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
          content<span class="token punctuation">:</span> comment
        <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
                        </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>A method to add an event listener to the submit button.</li>
                <li>An <code>addComment</code> method</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Build out the objects and modules decided on in step 1.</p>
            <p>Create a new module for our Comments code. Create a class with a constructor to act as the controller.
                The constructor should set a local property called <code>type</code> when the class is instantiated.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>As you start thinking about implementing your module...think back to the Todo list we made. This is
                    in many ways similar to that. We need a form to gather some user input, we need a button with a
                    listener to store that into an array (and eventually LocalStorage), and we need to display a list of
                    our comments. The biggest difference here is that we don't always want to show the entry form, and
                    we want our module to be reusable.</p>
                <p>Still there are enough simularities that you could probably use your ToDo code as a starting point
                    for this. A couple of recommendations for changes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We could end up with more than one type of comments, and more than one list of comments. If you
                        haven't already, take the methods for adding and removing comments and our comment list and
                        build an additional class around them. Call it something like <code>CommentModel</code>.</li>
                    <li>Depending on how you hide/show your comment entry form you could end up with issues with your
                        listeners. If you start getting funny behavior try using <code>element.ontouchend =
                            callback</code>, instead of <code>element.addEventListener('touchend', callback)</code> when
                        you attach the listener to your button. This will ensure that you only ever have one listener
                        attached to the button at a time.</li>
                    <li>One additional change (for the stretch) is that we need to include the name of the hike the
                        comment is for in our saved comment. Consider how you will get that information into your
                        listener so that the callback can use it.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Create a method in the class called <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd>. For now it can just return some static
                text or log something out to the console.</p>
            <p>Insert your comment class into the hike class by adding a <code>new</code> instance of the comment class
                in the constructor. Call the <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd> method when the list of hikes is shown to make
                sure that you have things connected up correctly.</p>
            <p>When you are looking at a specific hike it should allow you to enter a new comment, and should show all
                the comments below that form.</p>
            <p>Write the rest of the code to implement your commenting system. For now just store your comments in an
                array.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Store It.</p>
            <p>Write the model code to store and retrieve the comments to/from local storage.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
